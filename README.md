# CS300 Data Structures Algorithms Reflection 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem was searching through and printing from a database of college classes. Users need to be able to enter options into a menu and have their queries quickly answered. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
This isn't just a problem for sorting college courses but any search. Think of an online store like Amazon, where you have to quickly find one product out of thousands. Using the correct data structure and algorithm, make this process quicker.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One of my biggest blockers was trying to understand O notation. I found seeing how it was calculated for various code snippets to be helpful. I referenced Zybooks regularly while finishing the runtime analysis. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
One thing I will work more on in the future is writing better pseudocode. Planning out my code in project one made developing the course search code much faster. I even noticed that I rewrote or moved code to a different spot less frequently. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Not only did I get a better understanding of data structures, but also learned more about C++. It is a language I want to focus on learning more. The second part of the project helped me understand the best way to structure a code file that handled multiple functions.
